Implement the scheduling algorithms SRTF (pre-emptive), SJF(non-pre-emptive) and Round RobinCPU Scheduling (quantum=5) and Virtual Round Robin algorithm (quantum=5) for the sampledatagiven below. Assume all processes are CPU bound.
All programs should print various performance measures (turnaround time, waiting time, responsetime for each process and system throughput)
Assume that there is only one CPU and one I/O device in the system. The I/O device can be assumedto be sequential i.e. it serves only one process at a time. Save the above data in a file as shown below and read data from that file. File Data Format.
(Line No , Process name, Arrival Time, Burst Time,I/O time,After CPU burst Time)
